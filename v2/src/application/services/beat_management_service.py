Beat Management Service for Sprint 2

Service for managing beat operations in sequences.
This service will provide the business logic for beat manipulation
operations that the button panel will use through the WorkbenchButtonInterface.

# Sprint 2 Integration Notes:
# ===========================
#
# When implementing Sprint 2 button panel:
#
# 1. Use WorkbenchButtonInterfaceAdapter to connect to ModernSequenceWorkbench
# 2. Inject BeatManagementService into button panel components
# 3. Implement actual beat manipulation logic in this service
# 4. Add proper error handling and validation
# 5. Ensure all operations maintain sequence integrity
# 6. Add unit tests for all beat operations
#
# Example Sprint 2 usage:
#
# ```python
# # In button panel component
# beat_service = container.resolve(IBeatManagementService)
# workbench_interface = workbench.get_button_interface()
#
# # Delete selected beat
# current_sequence = workbench_interface.get_current_sequence()
# selected_index = workbench_interface.get_selected_beat_index()
#
# if current_sequence and selected_index is not None:
#     updated_sequence = beat_service.delete_beat(current_sequence, selected_index)
#     workbench_interface.update_sequence_display()
# ```
