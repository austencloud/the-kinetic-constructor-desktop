# V2 Motion Generation Implementation Guide

## üéØ Mission: Implement V1's Data-Driven Motion Generation in V2

This folder contains comprehensive documentation for implementing V1's proven motion generation system in V2. The goal is to achieve **pixel-perfect functional parity** with V1's option picker by adopting V1's data-driven approach.

## üìã Project Overview

**Current State**: V2 has a working standalone option picker test but uses hardcoded test data instead of V1's actual motion generation algorithms.

**Target State**: V2 option picker that generates identical motion combinations to V1 by using V1's dataset and position-matching algorithm.

## üîç Key Discovery

**V1 doesn't "generate" motions algorithmically - it retrieves pre-computed valid combinations from a dataset using simple position matching.**

Algorithm: `pictograph.start_pos == last_beat.end_pos`

## üöÄ Quick Start

1. **Read the Algorithm Analysis** (`01_ALGORITHM_ANALYSIS.md`) to understand V1's system
2. **Follow the Implementation Plan** (`02_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`) step by step
3. **Test with Alpha 1** to verify identical results to V1
4. **Expand to full dataset** once core algorithm works

## ‚úÖ Success Criteria

- [ ] Alpha 1 selection generates identical letters to V1 (D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, etc.)
- [ ] Letters are assigned to correct sections (Type1, Type2, Type3, etc.)
- [ ] Motion data matches V1's exactly (motion types, locations, rotations)
- [ ] Pictographs render with pixel-perfect visual fidelity to V1
- [ ] No Qt object deletion cascade issues
- [ ] Performance matches or exceeds V1

## üéØ Implementation Philosophy

**Data-Driven, Not Rule-Based**: Use V1's pre-computed dataset rather than trying to generate motions algorithmically.

**Position Matching**: The core algorithm is simple position matching, not complex motion validation.

**Proven Patterns**: Adopt V1's successful patterns (object pooling, sectional assignment, dataset structure).
