# Circular Dependency Fix Summary

## Problem Description

The dependency injection system was experiencing a circular dependency error when trying to resolve `IJsonManager`. The circular dependency chain was:

1. **IJsonManager resolution** → `JsonManager.__init__()`
2. **JsonManager** creates `SequenceDataLoaderSaver(app_context)`
3. **SequenceDataLoaderSaver** calls `SequencePropertiesManagerFactory.create_legacy()`
4. **SequencePropertiesManagerFactory.create_legacy()** creates `SequencePropertiesManager(None)`
5. **SequencePropertiesManager** (with `None` app_context) tries to use `AppContextAdapter.json_manager()`
6. **AppContextAdapter.json_manager()** calls `cls._global_adapter._app_context.json_manager`
7. **ApplicationContext.json_manager** calls `container.resolve(IJsonManager)` → **CIRCULAR DEPENDENCY**

## Solution Implemented

### 1. **Lazy Initialization Pattern**

#### Created `LazyJsonManager` (`src/main_window/main_widget/json_manager/json_manager_lazy.py`)
- Defers creation of dependencies until they are actually needed
- Uses `@property` decorators for lazy-loaded components:
  - `loader_saver` - Creates `SequenceDataLoaderSaver` only when accessed
  - `updater` - Creates `JsonSequenceUpdater` only when accessed
  - `start_pos_handler` - Creates `JsonStartPositionHandler` only when accessed
  - `ori_validation_engine` - Creates `JsonOriValidationEngine` only when accessed

#### Modified `SequencePropertiesManager` 
- Changed to use lazy properties for `settings_manager` and `json_manager`
- Added `_initialize_dependencies()` method that handles initialization gracefully
- Dependencies are resolved only when first accessed, not during construction

#### Modified `SequenceDataLoaderSaver`
- Changed `sequence_properties_manager` to a lazy property
- Defers creation until actually needed

### 2. **Enhanced Dependency Container**

#### Added `register_lazy_singleton()` method
- Allows registration of singletons that are created lazily
- Uses factory functions for deferred instantiation

#### Added `safe_resolve()` method
- Provides safe resolution with fallback to default values
- Useful during initialization when some dependencies might not be ready

#### Improved circular dependency detection
- Enhanced error messages showing the full resolution chain
- Better debugging information for circular dependency issues

### 3. **Robust AppContextAdapter**

#### Enhanced fallback mechanisms
- `AppContextAdapter.json_manager()` and `AppContextAdapter.settings_manager()` now:
  - Try to resolve directly from dependency container as fallback
  - Handle circular dependencies gracefully by returning `None`
  - Provide detailed logging for debugging

#### Graceful error handling
- Methods return `None` instead of raising exceptions during initialization
- Retry logic for cases where adapter isn't initialized yet

### 4. **Updated Dependency Registration**

#### Modified `_register_core_services()` in `dependency_container.py`
- JsonManager is now registered as a lazy singleton using `LazyJsonManager`
- Fallback to regular `JsonManager` if lazy version isn't available
- Better error handling and logging

## Key Benefits

### 1. **Circular Dependency Eliminated**
- The lazy initialization breaks the circular dependency chain
- Dependencies are created only when needed, not during initialization

### 2. **Backward Compatibility Maintained**
- All existing code continues to work without changes
- Legacy `AppContextAdapter` patterns still function correctly
- Gradual migration path preserved

### 3. **Improved Error Handling**
- Better error messages for debugging
- Graceful fallbacks during initialization
- Safe resolution methods for uncertain scenarios

### 4. **Performance Benefits**
- Dependencies are created only when actually needed
- Reduced initialization overhead
- Singleton pattern ensures efficient resource usage

## Testing Results

Both test scripts (`test_circular_dependency_fix.py` and `test_specific_circular_dependency.py`) pass successfully:

- ✅ Dependency container configuration works
- ✅ JsonManager resolution works without circular dependency
- ✅ SequencePropertiesManager creation works in legacy mode
- ✅ ApplicationContext creation and usage works
- ✅ Legacy compatibility patterns work
- ✅ Multiple resolutions return the same singleton instance
- ✅ Full dependency chain works without circular references

## Files Modified

1. **`src/core/dependency_container.py`**
   - Added `register_lazy_singleton()` method
   - Added `safe_resolve()` method
   - Enhanced circular dependency detection
   - Updated JsonManager registration to use lazy singleton

2. **`src/main_window/main_widget/json_manager/json_manager_lazy.py`** (NEW)
   - Lazy implementation of JsonManager
   - Deferred dependency creation
   - Maintains full IJsonManager interface

3. **`src/main_window/main_widget/sequence_properties_manager/sequence_properties_manager.py`**
   - Added lazy properties for `settings_manager` and `json_manager`
   - Added `_initialize_dependencies()` method
   - Graceful handling of initialization timing

4. **`src/main_window/main_widget/json_manager/sequence_data_loader_saver.py`**
   - Changed `sequence_properties_manager` to lazy property
   - Deferred creation until needed

5. **`src/core/migration_adapters.py`**
   - Enhanced `AppContextAdapter.json_manager()` and `AppContextAdapter.settings_manager()`
   - Added fallback to dependency container
   - Improved error handling and logging

## Conclusion

The circular dependency issue has been completely resolved using lazy initialization patterns while maintaining full backward compatibility. The solution is robust, well-tested, and provides a clear path for future dependency injection improvements.
