## 1. Introduction

This document details the strategy for migrating the sequence_workbench and beat_frame components from their current architecture to the new MVVM with Services architecture. It also outlines a comprehensive testing strategy to ensure the quality, stability, and correctness of the refactored application.

The migration will be phased, aligning with the "Implementation Roadmap," to minimize disruption and allow for iterative testing and refinement.

## 2. Migration Strategy

The migration will be approached by gradually replacing old components with their new MVVM counterparts, while ensuring the application remains functional (or at least testable in parts) throughout the process.

### 2.1. Guiding Principles for Migration

**Iterative Replacement:** Replace modules and components one by one or in small, manageable groups.

**Abstraction Layers (Anti-Corruption Layer):** Where necessary, create temporary adapter or facade classes to allow new components to interact with old ones (and vice-versa) during the transition. This helps isolate the new architecture from the old.

**Feature Parity First:** Aim to achieve existing functionality with the new architecture before adding significant new features.

**Data Model as the Core:** Prioritize the migration of data handling to the new SequenceDataModel and services.

**Version Control:** Utilize feature branches extensively in Git for each phase or significant component migration.

**Regular Integration:** Integrate and test frequently to catch issues early.

### 2.2. Phased Migration Steps (aligns with Implementation Roadmap)

#### Phase 1: Core Architecture Foundation (Migration Focus)

**Old Code:** Existing JSON loading logic, parts of AppContext.json_manager, initial data structures within Beat objects.

**New Code:** SequenceDataModel, BeatDataModel, SequenceManagementService (for loading/saving new models).

**Migration Activity:**

- Develop SequenceManagementService to read existing JSON sequence files and transform their data into the new SequenceDataModel and BeatDataModel structures
- Initially, the old UI might still operate on its existing data structures. The SequenceManagementService can act as a temporary bridge, converting new models back to the old format if needed for parts of the UI not yet migrated (though this should be minimized)

**Rollback:** Revert to old JSON loading if new model parsing is problematic.

#### Phase 2: Component Modernization (Migration Focus)

**Old Code:** SequenceBeatFrame, BeatView (old version), BeatAdder, BeatFramePopulator, BeatFrameLayoutManager, BeatFrameUpdater, BeatSelectionOverlay.

**New Code:** SequenceBeatFrameView, BeatView (MVVM), StartPositionView, SequenceBeatFrameViewModel, BeatViewModel, LayoutCalculationService, parts of BeatOperationsService.

**Migration Activity:**

_SequenceBeatFrame Replacement:_

- Create the new SequenceBeatFrameView and its SequenceBeatFrameViewModel
- Initially, populate SequenceBeatFrameViewModel using SequenceManagementService (from Phase 1)
- The SequenceBeatFrameView will start rendering the new BeatView (MVVM) widgets
- The old SequenceBeatFrame can be swapped out in the main application layout once the new view can display sequences

_Beat Display:_

- The new BeatView (MVVM) will render data from its BeatViewModel. The complex rendering logic from the old Pictograph (if Beat was a QGraphicsScene) needs to be replicated or adapted in the BeatView's paintEvent or its internal QGraphicsScene based on BeatViewModel.visual_attributes

_Beat Operations:_

- Replace BeatAdder logic with commands in SequenceBeatFrameViewModel that use BeatOperationsService
- Replace BeatFrameUpdater logic with reactive updates in ViewModels listening to model changes
- Replace BeatSelectionOverlay with the new SelectionOverlayView driven by selection state in ViewModels

_Layout:_

- Replace BeatFrameLayoutManager with LayoutCalculationService and dynamic layout logic within SequenceBeatFrameView

_Data Flow:_ Ensure user interactions in new views correctly flow to ViewModels, then to services, updating the SequenceDataModel, and reactively updating the UI.

**Rollback:** Temporarily switch back to the old SequenceBeatFrame if the new one has critical issues. Keep old manager classes available but inactive.

#### Phase 3: Performance Optimization & Advanced Features (Migration Focus)

**Old Code:** ImageExportManager and its sub-components, parts of ReversalDetector if logic is scattered.

**New Code:** ImageExportService (decoupled), UndoRedoService, refined BeatOperationsService.

**Migration Activity:**

_Image Export:_

- Implement the ImageExportService to render directly from SequenceDataModel. This is a significant rewrite of the image generation logic, moving away from BeatGrabber and live UI components
- The old ImageExportManager can be kept as a fallback or for comparison during development
- Integrate background threading for the new export service

_Undo/Redo:_

- Wrap operations in BeatOperationsService (and other services modifying SequenceDataModel) with Commands for the UndoRedoService
- Connect UI elements (buttons) to undo/redo slots in relevant ViewModels

_Reversal Logic:_ Consolidate and refine reversal detection logic within BeatOperationsService or a dedicated ReversalDetectionService, operating on SequenceDataModel.

**Rollback:** For image export, can temporarily revert to using the old ImageExportManager. For undo/redo, this is a new feature, so rollback means disabling it.

#### Phase 4: Testing and Refinement (Migration Focus)

**Migration Activity:**

- Remove any remaining old code paths, adapter layers, or fallback mechanisms that are no longer needed
- Ensure all data previously handled by old components is now fully managed by the new models and services
- Finalize any data conversion logic if current JSON files need permanent transformation to a new schema optimized for SequenceDataModel

### 2.3. Data Migration (JSON Structure)

The current JSON structure needs to be mapped to SequenceDataModel and BeatDataModel.

The SequenceManagementService will be responsible for this translation during loading.

**Consideration:** Decide if the JSON file format itself should be updated to more closely mirror the new SequenceDataModel. If so, a one-time conversion utility might be needed for existing user files, or the service can support reading the old format and saving in the new. For simplicity during migration, supporting read of old format and save in a new/adapted format is often preferred.

### 2.4. Rollback Plan

**Version Control:** Use Git branches for each phase/feature. If a migration step proves too problematic, revert the branch or switch back to the main/stable branch.

**Feature Flags (Optional):** For larger components, consider using feature flags (e.g., loaded from settings) to switch between old and new implementations during the transition period. This allows for easier A/B testing or quick disabling of a new problematic component.

**Keep Old Code (Temporarily):** Do not delete old code immediately. Rename or move it to an "deprecated" or "legacy" folder until the new system is stable and validated.

## 3. Testing Strategy

A multi-layered testing approach will be employed to ensure the quality and correctness of the refactored application.

### 3.1. Unit Testing

**Scope:** Individual functions, methods, and classes in isolation.

**Targets:**

- Models: Validation logic, update() methods, data integrity
- Services: Business logic, data transformations, interactions with (mocked) other services or data sources
- ViewModels: Property computations, command logic, state changes in response to model/service updates (with services mocked)

**Tools:** pytest framework. unittest.mock for mocking dependencies.

**Examples:**

- Test BeatDataModel.update() correctly changes attributes
- Test BeatOperationsService.add_new_beat_to_sequence() correctly updates SequenceDataModel (given a mock SequenceDataModel)
- Test BeatViewModel.display_beat_number property returns correct string for various durations
- Test SequenceBeatFrameViewModel.add_beat_command calls the correct service method

### 3.2. Integration Testing

**Scope:** Interaction between different components of the new architecture.

**Targets:**

- ViewModel ↔ Service interactions
- Service ↔ Model interactions
- ViewModel ↔ Model interactions (especially notifications and updates)
- End-to-end data flow for specific operations (e.g., loading a sequence, adding a beat, and verifying the SequenceDataModel and ViewModel states)

**Tools:** pytest. May involve setting up a minimal application context with real service instances (but potentially mocked external dependencies like file system).

**Examples:**

- Test that loading a JSON file via SequenceManagementService correctly populates a SequenceDataModel, which then correctly updates SequenceBeatFrameViewModel and its BeatViewModels
- Test that executing add_beat_command in SequenceBeatFrameViewModel results in the BeatOperationsService modifying the SequenceDataModel, and the ViewModel reflects this change

### 3.3. UI Testing (Functional/Acceptance Testing)

**Scope:** Testing the application from the user's perspective, interacting with the GUI.

**Targets:**

- Visual correctness of BeatView rendering based on BeatDataModel
- Correct behavior of UI controls (buttons, selections)
- Responsiveness of the layout to window resizing
- Functionality of drag-and-drop (if applicable and refactored)
- Image export output matches expectations for various sequences and options
- Undo/redo functionality works as expected for all relevant operations

**Methods:**

_Manual Testing:_ Structured test cases executed by testers/developers.

_Automated UI Testing (Optional but Recommended for Key Flows):_

- Tools: pytest-qt can simulate user events (clicks, key presses) and assert widget states
- Focus: Critical paths like adding/deleting beats, sequence loading, selection, basic image export. Automated UI tests can be brittle, so focus on stable, high-value scenarios

**Test Cases (Examples):**

- TC-UI-001: Load an existing sequence JSON file. Verify all beats are displayed correctly with their letters and numbers
- TC-UI-002: Add a new beat. Verify it appears in the correct position and the sequence word/difficulty updates
- TC-UI-003: Select a beat. Verify it's visually highlighted and the graph editor updates
- TC-UI-004: Change the duration of a beat. Verify beat numbering of subsequent beats updates correctly
- TC-UI-005: Export a sequence to PNG with specific options. Verify the output image content and layout
- TC-UI-006: Perform an "add beat" operation, then undo. Verify the beat is removed. Then redo. Verify the beat is re-added
- TC-UI-007: Resize the main window. Verify the beat frame layout adjusts correctly without visual glitches or excessive lag

### 3.4. Performance Testing

**Scope:** Measuring the responsiveness and resource usage of the application.

**Targets:**

- Sequence loading time for small, medium, and large (e.g., 64 beats) sequences
- UI responsiveness during beat addition/deletion in large sequences
- Frame rate and CPU usage during window resizing with many beats displayed
- Memory usage before and after loading/closing large sequences (to detect leaks)
- Image export time for complex sequences

**Tools:**

- Python's cProfile and pstats for code profiling
- memory_profiler for memory usage
- Manual timing for specific operations
- Qt's built-in performance monitoring tools if available/applicable

**Metrics:**

- Time to complete operations (e.g., load sequence < X ms)
- CPU utilization during specific tasks
- Memory footprint

### 3.5. Regression Testing

**Scope:** Ensuring that new changes or bug fixes do not break existing functionality.

**Method:** Re-run relevant subsets of unit, integration, and UI tests after each significant change or bug fix.

**Automation:** A good suite of automated unit and integration tests is crucial for effective regression testing.

### 3.6. User Acceptance Testing (UAT)

**Scope:** Validation by end-users or stakeholders that the refactored application meets their requirements and expectations.

**Method:** Provide beta versions of the application to selected users with specific scenarios to test. Collect feedback on functionality, usability, and performance.

**Focus:** Overall user experience, correctness of complex workflows, and any deviations from expected behavior of the original application (unless the change is an intentional improvement).

## 4. Quality Assurance Metrics (Post-Migration)

To evaluate the success of the migration and redesign, the following metrics will be tracked and compared against the "Before Redesign" grades:

**Code Maintainability and Readability:**

- After Grade Target: A-
- Measurement: Code review scores, cyclomatic complexity, ease of onboarding new developers to the module
