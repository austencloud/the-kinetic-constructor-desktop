**Date:** May 31, 2025  
**Prepared for:** User  
**Prepared by:** Gemini Large Language Model  
**Version:** 1.0  
**Based on:** Modern Architecture Design Document (ID: modern_architecture_design_v1)

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines a phased implementation roadmap for refactoring the sequence_workbench and beat_frame components of the User's PyQt6 application. The goal is to transition from the current architecture to the modern MVVM with Services architecture detailed in the "Modern Architecture Design Document."

This roadmap is divided into four distinct phases, each with specific objectives, tasks, deliverables, and estimated timelines. It also includes considerations for risk mitigation and dependencies.

## 2. Overall Project Timeline Estimate

**Total Estimated Duration:** 8 - 11 weeks

- **Phase 1:** Core Architecture Foundation (2-3 weeks)
- **Phase 2:** Component Modernization (3-4 weeks)
- **Phase 3:** Performance Optimization & Advanced Features (2 weeks)
- **Phase 4:** Testing and Refinement (1-2 weeks)

## 3. Phase 1: Core Architecture Foundation

**Duration:** 2-3 weeks

**Goal:** Establish the foundational elements of the new MVVM architecture, including data models, core services, and basic ViewModel structures. This phase focuses on creating the backbone of the new system without fully migrating all UI components.

### 3.1. Objectives

- Define and implement core DataModel classes (SequenceDataModel, BeatDataModel, MotionDataModel, SettingsModel)
- Implement initial versions of key services (SequenceManagementService, SettingsService, basic BeatOperationsService, ServiceLocator/DI Container)
- Create base ViewModel classes and initial SequenceBeatFrameViewModel
- Set up the project structure for the new architecture (e.g., directories for models, views, viewmodels, services)
- Establish basic data flow for loading and representing a sequence in the new models

### 3.2. Key Tasks & Deliverables

| Task                                                   | Deliverable(s)                                                               | Estimated Effort | Dependencies         |
| ------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------- | -------------------- |
| 1.1. Define Data Models                                | Python files for SequenceDataModel, BeatDataModel, MotionDataModel           | 2-3 days         | None                 |
| 1.2. Implement SettingsModel & SettingsService         | SettingsModel.py, SettingsService.py (basic get/set)                         | 1-2 days         | Task 1.1 (partially) |

- Implement BeatViewModel and connect it to BeatView
- Refactor SequenceBeatFrameView to display a list of BeatViews based on SequenceBeatFrameViewModel
- Implement core beat manipulation logic (add, delete, select) through ViewModel commands and services
- Integrate the responsive layout system for the SequenceBeatFrameView
- Begin refactoring related components like GraphEditor and InformationPanel to use ViewModels
