# Construct Tab Nuclear Rebuild - Overview

## üìã Executive Summary

This project transforms the current construct tab from a legacy PyQt6 implementation into a modern, performant, and maintainable component using 2025-level architecture patterns.

## üéØ Project Goals

- **Modern Architecture**: Component-based, reactive state management
- **Performance**: 50-70% faster loading, smooth 60fps animations
- **Maintainability**: 50% reduction in code complexity
- **User Experience**: Responsive design with preserved glassmorphism styling
- **Future-Proof**: Extensible architecture for continued development
