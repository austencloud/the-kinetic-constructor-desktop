- **Phase 2**: Disable feature flags, use legacy components
- **Phase 3**: Disable enhanced features, use basic new components
- **Phase 4**: Targeted rollbacks for specific issues

#### Component-Level Rollback

Individual components can be rolled back using feature flags:

```python
if feature_flags.is_enabled('modern_navigation'):
    return ModernNavigationView()
else:
    return LegacyNavigationView()
```
