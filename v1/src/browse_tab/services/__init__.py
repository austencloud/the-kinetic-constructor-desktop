Services package for Browse Tab v2 - Clean Architecture Implementation.

This package contains service layer components that handle business logic,
data management, and cross-cutting concerns following the single responsibility principle.

Services:
- SequenceDataService: Sequence loading and management (new)
- SequenceService: Existing sequence service
- FilterService: Filtering and search logic
- CacheService: Existing cache service
- PerformanceCacheService: New performance-optimized caching (new)
- AsyncImageLoader: Image loading service
- PerformanceMonitor: Performance monitoring

Each service is designed to be:
- Single responsibility focused
- Testable in isolation
- Performance optimized
- Error resilient
