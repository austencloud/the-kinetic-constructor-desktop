# TODO

- Analyze sequences for prop, full, and hand reversals
- Standardize naming conventions automatically - reassemble pictographs
  - Allow users to select from the middle of a circular sequence when constructing an act
- Allow user-defined names for sequence variations
- Customize pictograph thumbnails for prop type or visibility
- More customizable variables in the browser options panel
- Add an undo feature
- When making a mirrored circular sequence that starts in alpha, we need an option to color swap the second half (which would necessitate ending at the vertically mirrored version of the start position )
- We need to have a way to make a strict mirrored sequence that starts in Gamma by marking the vertically reflected positions as the intended end position to the word.
