# TODO

- Analyze sequences for prop, full, and hand reversals
- Standardize naming conventions automatically - reassemble pictographs
  - Allow users to select from the middle of a circular sequence when constructing an act
- Allow user-defined names for sequence variations
- Customize pictograph thumbnails for prop type or visibility
- More customizable variables in the browser options panel
- Add an undo feature
- When making a mirrored circular sequence that starts in alpha, we need an option to color swap the second half (which would necessitate ending at the vertically mirrored version of the start position )
- We need to have a way to make a strict mirrored sequence that starts in Gamma by marking the vertically reflected positions as the intended end position to the word. 
- When the user clicks the generate new sequence numerous times in secession, it should not Append the end of the current sequence beyond the amount that it's supposed to. In other words, in other words, it should be sensitive to the Jason population and cancel it and restart it whenever we generate a new sequence.
