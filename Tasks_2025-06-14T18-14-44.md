-[x] NAME:Investigate Option Picker Data Flow DESCRIPTION:Use codebase-retrieval to trace complete data flow from option picker selection through to beat frame update, identify signal/slot connections and fallback mechanism triggers
-[x] NAME:Implement Graph Data Extraction DESCRIPTION:Extract motion data, positions, and beat properties from selected options and replace fallback mechanism with proper graph data retrieval
-[x] NAME:Fix Integration Points DESCRIPTION:Update signal/slot connections between option picker and workbench to carry graph data, update beat creation logic to use actual option data
-[/] NAME:Real-World Testing DESCRIPTION:Run iterative testing with actual application to verify option picker selections create proper beats with correct graph data instead of fallback Î² beats
